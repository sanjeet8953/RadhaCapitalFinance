        <h4>Money Back Policy</h4>
        <p>A money back policy is a type of life insurance plan
            that combines protection with regular payouts during
            the policy tenure. It not only provides life coverage
            but also ensures assured returns at specific intervals, 
            making it a dependable savings and investment option for long-term 
            objectives. This plan is particularly suitable for individuals who prefer
            periodic returns instead of a lump-sum payout at the end.</p>

        <h4 class="mt-4">What is a Money Back Policy?</h4>
        <p>
            A money back policy is a special form of life insurance that combines 
            security with liquidity. Unlike conventional plans that release the full 
            benefit only at maturity or on the insured’s death, this policy distributes
            periodic payouts, called survival benefits, throughout the duration of the plan. 
            These payments are intended to help meet significant life events or recurring financial requirements.</p>

            <p>In the event of the policyholder’s untimely 
            death during the term, the nominee is still entitled to 
            receive the complete sum assured, irrespective of the payouts 
            already made. This mix of regular income and insurance cover makes 
            it an ideal option for those who want to align their long-term savings
            with short-term financial obligations.
        </p>
        <h4>How Does a Money Back Policy Work?</h4>
        <p>Consider a 25-year-old individual who opts for a 25-year money back plan with 
            a sum assured of ₹15 lakhs. This policy is structured to provide 15% of the sum 
            assured every five years as survival benefits.</p>
        <h5>Payout schedule:</h5>
            <ul>
            <li>End of 5th year: ₹2.25 lakhs</li>
            <li>End of 10th year: ₹2.25 lakhs</li>
            <li>End of 15th year: ₹2.25 lakhs</li>
            <li>End of 20th year: ₹2.25 lakhs</li>
            </ul>
        <p>At the end of the 25th year, the policyholder receives the balance amount of ₹6 lakhs, plus any bonuses, as the maturity benefit.</p>
        <p>In case of the policyholder’s unfortunate demise during the policy term, the nominee will still receive the complete sum assured of ₹15 lakhs,
            irrespective of the survival benefits already paid. This ensures that the family’s financial security is not compromised.</p>

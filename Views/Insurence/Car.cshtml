		<h4 style="color:#994848">Car insurance for EVs</h4>
		<p>
			Car insurance for electric vehicles (EVs) helps cover
			the cost of repairs if your EV is damaged by natural
			events like floods or storms, or by man-made incidents
			like accidents or vandalism. Just like regular car
			insurance, it also covers third-party liabilities as
			per the policy terms. If you own an EV, this cover
			can protect you from high repair costs and keep your
			vehicle on the road. As electric cars become more
			popular, knowing about EV-specific cover can help
			you choose the right protection for your vehicle.

			What factors impact Insured’s
			Declared Value (IDV)?
		</h4>
		<p>IDV in car insurance plays a key role in determining your car insurance price</p>
		<p>
			In a car insurance policy, the Insured’s Declared Value (IDV)
			is the fixed value at which we insure your vehicle. We calculate
			the policy sum insured based on the manufacturer's listed selling
			price of the vehicle + the listed cost of any accessories.
			We derive the amount after deducting the depreciation for every
			year as per the Indian Motor Tariff.
		</p>
		<p>
			Suppose you have installed any electronic item in the car,
			which is not included in the manufacturer's listed selling
			price. In that case, we add the actual value (after depreciation)
			of the item to the policy sum insured over and above the IDV.

			How can you save on your
			car insurance premium +
		</h4>
		<p>No matter what type of car you drive, certain discounts can bring down your car insurance price -</p>
		<p><b>No Claim Bonus in Car Insurance</b></p>
		<p>If you made no claims in the past years, you get up to 50% NCB.</p>
		<p><b>Security measures</b></p>
		<p>If you’ve taken special measures to keep your car from getting stolen, you are eligible
			for a discount on your car insurance premium. Typically, you would receive a 2.5% 
			discount for fitting an anti-theft device (approved by ARAI) on your car.</p>
		<p>It is unwise to reduce IDV to save on premium. In case of an accident, you would 
			find yourself at a disadvantage. Instead, ride safe and take security measures 
			to get discounts on car insurance.</p>
